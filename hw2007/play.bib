  overview =     "In previous papers we have proposed an elementary
                 discipline of strong functional programming (ESFP), in
                 which all computations terminate. A key feature of the
                 discipline is that we introduce a type distinction
                 between data which is known to be finite, and codata
                 which is (potentially) infinite. To ensure termination,
                 recursion over data must be well--founded, and
                 corecursion (the definition schema for codata) must be
                 productive, and both of these restrictions must be
                 enforced automatically by the compiler. In our previous
                 work we used abstract interpretation to establish the
                 productivity of corecursive definitions in an
                 elementary strong functional language. We show here
                 that similar ideas can be applied in the dual case to
                 check whether recursive function definitions are
                 strongly normalising. We thus exhibit a powerful
                 termination analysis technique which we demonstrate can
                 be extended to partial functions.",
